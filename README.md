# 🌦 Weather Forecast App

A simple and minimal weather forecast application built using **React** that fetches real-time and forecasted weather data from the **OpenWeather API**, and visualizes it using **Chart.js**.

The goal of this project was to learn how to work with external APIs, handle asynchronous data, and convert raw values into meaningful visual representations inside a React UI.
